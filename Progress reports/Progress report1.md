## Intro

We've uploaded our project to GitHub here: https://github.com/theamici/Epic-Machine-Learning-Task-Force, where you can look at the content mentioned below.

## What We've Done

* We have created the repository (and started learning simple git), added data files, added a jupyter file called Task1 for the first task. We will make similar jupyter files for the other tasks later.
* We have created a file with the beginnings of a work plan, organizing our work. This is called "Work Plan and Execution.md"
* We have made tentative decisions for 4 algorithms we will try out (one for each group member). Detailed in the work plan. Further discussions and evaluations of the algorithms are pending (many of us currently feel we don't know the algorithms well enough to make a definitive decision yet of what we'll go for).
* We've started probing the data in the Task1 Jupyter file, and already made our first discovery, that "veil-type" is a useless feature as every single datapoint has the same value, namely "partial". We've also discussed dividing up the work of making similar investigations for all the features, such that each person check out 5-6 features each and try and discover something strange or interesting about their value distributions. We may also try to check across the different features, to discover likely dependencies, for instance that the value of one feature predicts the value of another.
