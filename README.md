 # How To Setup
1. Find some location (folder) you want to store the project in. Open the location in Github Desktop and clone the repository from Github to this folder (see guides on how repository cloning is done with Github Desktop).
2. Set up an Anaconda environment for the cloned repository on your computer. I used Anaconda command-line interface to do this. Opening the CLI, I navigated to the location of the repository, then I used commands (with EpicML as environment name):
    * conda create -n EpicML numpy pandas scipy matplotlib
    * conda activate EpicML
3. If you open up the Anaconda Navigator on Windows, you can now find EpicML as one of the environments. Remember to install Jupyter Notebook for the environment. A main.ipynb file can already be found in the repository, ready to be worked on.
